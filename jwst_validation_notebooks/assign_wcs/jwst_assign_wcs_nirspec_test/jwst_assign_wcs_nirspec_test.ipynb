    "We compared Institute's pipeline product of the assign_wcs step with the intermediary products from the ESA pipeline, which is completely independent from the Institute's. We calculated the relative difference and expected it to be equal to or less than computer precision:  relative_difference = absolute_value( (ESA - ST)/ESA )  <= 1x10^-7. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the test to be considered PASSED, every single slit (for FS data), slitlet (for MOS data) or slice (for IFU data) in the input file has to pass. If there is any failure, the whole test will be considered as FAILED. \n",
